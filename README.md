# portfolio-website
My portfolio website built with ASP.NET Core MVC.

The website can function as a template and render information for different hardcoded profiles stored in its repository class.
To access the profiles, visit https://localhost:44352//home/index/1 or https://localhost:44352//home/index/2
Attempting to view a profile for which an Id does not exist will render a "Profile Not Found" View.
